            <h2>Network Security Implementing</h2>
            <p> In this project,  I took a responsibility to protect from network attack. The fundamental of our solution is out network that is comprised of the access, distribution, and core layer. 
                With the use of Cisco routers and switches, we have chosen to implement advanced protocols. The following table lists protocols that have implemented on the Cisco networking devices in order to
                protect the network against man-in-the-middle attacks and to control how traffic is transmitted and received
                within the network:
            </p>

                <table>

                        <td>HSRP</td>
                        <td>HSRP avoids administrative and processing
                            overhead and security issues so that there are
                            failover services for the following hosts.</td>

                            so that inbound traffic. This determines which traffic
                            is trusted or untrusted.
                            Network security is attained by ensuring that traffic
                            that is untrusted is dropped by layer 2 security
                            technology.

                            PortFast BPDU enabled so that loops are prevented.
                            BPDUs will not be received on PortFast-enabled
                            switch ports to avoid potential spanning tree loops.

                            access ports, the allocated maximum number of
                            ports is set to 1 so that any devices that attempt
                            to access the network.
                             2. Once a security violation has occurred the ports
                            have been configured to enter shutdown mode.
                             3. For the ports to retain MAC address information,
                            switches with a sticky mac address enabled then
                            dynamically learn and save MAC addresses.</td>

                <h2>Nessus Scanning</h2>
                <p>To ensure that all security measure are to proper standard we used Nessus Vulnerability Scanner to
                    evaluate the security of the network. We've performed penetration testing on the network the ensure that it
                    is safe from malicious attacks. The examination of ports is done so that hackers can't exploit these ports
                    and launch attacks that can be damaging to the network. This scan displays vulnerabilities that were found
                    throughout the network and with these results we then applied the corresponding solutions.
                    The first scan this procedure is launching a host discovery that displays full qualified domain name (FQDN),
                    along with other details such as IP address and open ports. Upon discovery of the network, we then
                    proceeded with the vulnerability scan.</p>

            <h2>Linux Firewall Configuring</h2>
            <p> I configure firewalls in Linux using tools like ufw for 
                simplicity or iptables for more advanced configurations. 
                I enable the firewall, allow essential connections like SSH or HTTP, 
                set default policies for incoming and outgoing traffic, and ensure rules 
                align with security requirements. I verify configurations with ufw status and make adjustments as needed. 
                I prioritize security while ensuring necessary services remain accessible, contributing to robust network 
                defense strategies.

            <h2>Window Policy Configuring</h2>
            <p>In a Windows environment, end user policy outlines user responsibilities and behavior expectations, 
                while password policy defines requirements for creating and managing passwords,
                aiming to enhance security. Group Policy enables administrators to centrally manage
                 settings across a network, enforcing security policies, standardizing configurations, 
                 and ensuring compliance. These policies collectively contribute to maintaining security,
                  integrity, and compliance within Windows environments.</p>
